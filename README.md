An environment for routing of sailing boats - unfinished

This is designed for a reinforcement-like approach to the multidimensional path planning problem of navigating a sailing boat, which involves dynamically (continuously) changing environments, which include uncertainty in itself (weather forecast is not perfect). 
Possibly this is not the most efficient way how to adress this problem. 

Currently the environment handles boats on small grid-worlds (can be altered and expanded easily), later it should be applied to the real world weather, forecasts, gps and boat data
